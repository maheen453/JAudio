# JAudio

A robust, object-oriented Java music application designed to manage songs, audiobooks, and podcasts. JAudio features efficient library management, dynamic playlist creation, and audio content downloads from a simulated online store. The app highlights core object-oriented programming principles, such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
Features

    Library Management: Store and organize audio content of various types, including songs, audiobooks, and podcasts.
    Audio Content Download: Simulate downloading audio content from an online store to populate the app's library.
    Playback Functionality: “Play” audio content by printing the lyrics or text for songs, audiobooks, or podcasts.
    Dynamic Playlists: Create playlists that can contain a mix of different types of audio content or just songs.

Object-Oriented Design Highlights

    Abstraction: Abstract classes for media content ensure a flexible and extensible hierarchy for adding new audio content types.
    Inheritance and Polymorphism: Common methods like play and download are implemented in a way that allows for consistent yet customizable behavior across songs, audiobooks, and podcasts.
    Encapsulation: Audio content data is secured within classes using private fields and accessed via public methods to maintain data integrity.
