# üéµ JAudio

**A Java-based music application for managing songs, audiobooks, with features like library management, dynamic playlist creation, and audio content downloads.** The project emphasizes a strong foundation in object-oriented programming (OOP) principles: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Object-Oriented Design
### Key OOP Concepts

- **Abstraction**:  
  Abstract classes for media content provide a flexible framework, making it simple to extend the hierarchy.
  - Example: `AudioContent` is an abstract class, and `Song`, `Audiobook`, and `Podcast` extend this to define specific behaviors.

- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**:  
  Unified behavior for `play` and `download` methods across different content types, with specialized functionality for each media type.
  - Example: Methods like `play()` and `download()` are implemented in subclasses, ensuring different media content behaves accordingly.

- **Encapsulation**:  
  Data security ensured by using private fields with public methods for controlled access to audio content properties.
  - Example: `AudioContent` stores fields like `title`, `artist`, and `genre` as private, providing public getters and setters for safe access.
